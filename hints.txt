*Dont over engineer with abstractions*
Keep things simplier
Add sprites to blocks

// Display square, give it control DONE//
// Make camera follow the player  DONE//

after prototype:
	physics and collisions
	Enemy behaviour (path finding and spawn)
	World generation (parlen noise)
	UI

//Only render blocks that visible to the camera
